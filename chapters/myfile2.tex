The Table of Contents should only list the sections to three (3) levels. A \verb|chapter{}| is level zero (0). A \verb|\section{}| is level one (1) and so a \verb|\subsection{}| is level two (2). In your thesis it is likely that you will even use a \verb|subsubsection{}|, which is level three (3). The depth to which the Table of Contents is formatted is set within \file{MastersDoctoralThesis.cls}. If you need this changed, you can do it in \file{main.tex}.
